The app reads content from a sound file and converts it to a BMP image. The image is in 240x640 RGB format.
The sound file must be in the following format:
	- uncompressed WAV
	- 11025Hz
	- 8 bit
You can convert an mp3 file to this format with Audacity, a free open source program you can find at https://www.audacityteam.org/
Press the "Convert" button to load your WAV file. Choose a filename and folder to save the BMP file when prompted. The program will display the resulting image. You will find the BMP file in the folder where you have saved it for any further manipulation, for storing or sharing it.
